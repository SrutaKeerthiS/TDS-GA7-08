## Dataset
Quarterly Equipment Efficiency Rates:
- Q1: 76.89
- Q2: 76.48
- Q3: 73.89
- Q4: 81.36
- **Average: 77.16**
- **Industry Target: 90**

## Key Findings
1. Average efficiency (77.16) is significantly below the industry benchmark (90).
2. Q3 shows the lowest performance (73.89), indicating possible downtime or maintenance issues.
3. Q4 shows a slight recovery (81.36), but still below target.

## Business Implications
- The efficiency gap (12.84 points) translates to higher **downtime**, **maintenance costs**, and **lower productivity**.
- Without intervention, the company risks falling behind competitors that already meet or exceed the 90 benchmark.

## Recommendations
- **Implement Predictive Maintenance Program**:
  - Use sensor data & machine learning models to predict equipment failures.
  - Schedule proactive maintenance to reduce downtime.
  - Allocate resources to underperforming equipment lines.
- **Benchmarking & Training**:
  - Compare best-performing equipment/processes.
  - Train operators in preventive measures.
